## Rails App - Blog based in Udemy course.

Used instructions from here [How to Build a Blog with Ruby on Rails](https://medium.com/@deallen7/ruby-on-rails-app-build-blog-3d9975a999ae)

**Blog functionality:**</br> 
 - CRUD and validations artilces, 
 - view with pagination, 
 - create, sign up, validations and authentication users,
 - show user profile and user's articles
 
**Skills I've trained while working on the Blog**  
1. Create a Pages Controller, View, routes and links between pages
2. Build Articles Model and Controller, add validations to Articles
3. Add Ability to Create\Editing\Destroy\Listing Articles From Browser
4. Refactor Forms into a Single Partial
5. Using **Bootstrap** for styling
